# Structural Programming - Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering
Includes all the codes I've written for problems &amp; projects during my 1st semester of Computer Science at FINKI for the subject "Artificial Intelligence"

**NOTE:** The problems that are written in Macedonian language differ from the ones in English not just by language - they are completely different problems.

All laboratory problems were solved in person, without any additional tools or help.
